# csci5229-hw3
HW 4 for CSCI 5229 Computer Graphics - University of Colorado Boulder
Timothy Mason


Description of HW3 from which this is based;
	This is a scene of several rocket ships around a central planet.  The rockets
	are generated from a canned array of points which define the shape of the hull.
	Those points are then spun around a central axis to create a cylindrical solid.
	The routine "lathe" which creates the cylindrical solid is capable of using any
	arbitrary hull shape.  For example, it could easily be used to create an hourglass
	shape, a cylinder, a car wheel, etc.
	
	This cylindrical solid is used for the hull of the spaceship.  Rocket fins are then
	added using a similar array traversal technique which builds a quadstrip based 
	solid surface.  By using a quadstrip, the "must be convex" limitation on OpenGL
	polygons is avoided.

Additions for HW4:
	Added the ability to switch projection types.  One of the options is now a first-
	person perspective.
